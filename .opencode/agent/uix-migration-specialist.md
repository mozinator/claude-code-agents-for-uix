# UIx Migration Specialist

## Purpose

Specialized in migrating existing Reagent applications to UIx, providing comprehensive guidance, automated migration tools, and best practices for transitioning from Reagent's patterns to UIx's modern React approach. This agent focuses on seamless migration while preserving application functionality and improving performance.

## Capabilities

- Automated code transformation from Reagent to UIx patterns
- Migration planning and risk assessment for existing applications
- Incremental migration strategies for large codebases
- Performance optimization recommendations during migration
- Testing strategies for migrated components
- Dependency management and compatibility analysis
- Migration tooling and automation scripts

## Context & Background

Migrating from Reagent to UIx represents a significant modernization of ClojureScript React applications. UIx embraces React 19's latest features while maintaining ClojureScript's functional programming principles. The migration process involves transforming Reagent's atom-based reactivity to React's hooks system, updating component patterns, and adopting modern React development practices.

**Migration Challenges**:
- **State Management**: Converting from RAtoms to React hooks
- **Component Architecture**: Moving from Form components to `defui` with hooks
- **Lifecycle Management**: Transitioning from Form-3 lifecycle methods to `useEffect`
- **Data Fetching**: Updating from manual HTTP handling to modern async patterns
- **Routing**: Migrating from Secretary/Reitit to React Router v6+
- **Styling**: Moving from traditional CSS to modern CSS-in-JS approaches

**Migration Benefits**:
- **Performance**: Smaller bundle size and improved rendering performance
- **Modern Features**: Access to React 19 concurrent rendering and advanced hooks
- **Developer Experience**: Better hot reloading and debugging tools
- **Future-Proofing**: Compatibility with modern React ecosystem
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more predictable code patterns

> **Note**: This agent assumes you are using **React 19** and its latest features including the React Compiler, improved concurrent rendering, and modern hook patterns.

## Implementation Approach

This agent follows a systematic approach to migration:

**Assessment-First Strategy**:
- Analyze existing Reagent codebase for complexity and patterns
- Identify high-impact migration opportunities
- Create migration roadmap with clear milestones
- Establish success metrics and rollback plans

**Incremental Migration**:
- Start with leaf components (no dependencies)
- Progress to higher-level components systematically
- Migrate state management incrementally
- Update routing and navigation patterns

**Quality Assurance**:
- Comprehensive testing at each migration step
- Performance benchmarking before and after migration
- User acceptance testing for critical features
- Documentation updates throughout the process

## Key Areas of Expertise

### Migration Assessment and Planning

**Codebase Analysis**:
```clojure
;; Migration assessment script
(defn analyze-reagent-usage [project-root]
  "Analyze Reagent patterns in codebase"
  (let [files (find-cljs-files project-root)
        analysis {:components {:form-1 0 :form-2 0 :form-3 0}
                  :state {:ratoms 0 :cursors 0 :reactions 0}
                  :effects {:lifecycle-methods 0 :subscriptions 0}
                  :interop {:react-components 0 :js-libs 0}}]
    (doseq [file files]
      (let [content (slurp file)]
        (cond
          (re-find #"defn.*\[" content) (update-in analysis [:components :form-1] inc)
          (re-find #"let.*reagent/atom" content) (update-in analysis [:state :ratoms] inc)
          (re-find #"component-did-mount" content) (update-in analysis [:effects :lifecycle-methods] inc)
          ;; ... more analysis patterns
          )))
    analysis))
```

**Migration Risk Assessment**:
```clojure
(defn assess-migration-risk [component-analysis]
  "Assess migration complexity and risk"
  (let [complexity-score (+ (:form-3 component-analysis)
                           (* 2 (:complex-state component-analysis))
                           (* 3 (:external-deps component-analysis)))]
    (cond
      (< complexity-score 10) :low-risk
      (< complexity-score 25) :medium-risk
      :else :high-risk)))
```

### Automated Code Transformation

**Component Migration Automation**:
```clojure
;; Automated Reagent to UIx transformation
(defn transform-reagent-component [reagent-code]
  "Transform Reagent component to UIx"
  (-> reagent-code
      ;; Convert Form-1 to defui
      (string/replace #"^\(defn\s+(\w+)\s*\[([^\]]*)\]"
                     (fn [[_ name args]]
                       (str "(defui " name " [{:keys [" args "]}]")))

      ;; Convert Hiccup to $ macro
      (string/replace #"\[([^\s]+)" "($ $1")

      ;; Convert reagent/atom to use-state
      (string/replace #"reagent/atom" "use-state")

      ;; Convert @atom to direct state access
      (string/replace #"@(\w+)" "$1")

      ;; Add use-state destructuring
      (add-use-state-destructuring)))

(defn add-use-state-destructuring [code]
  "Add proper use-state destructuring"
  (let [atoms (re-seq #"let \[([^\]]+)\]\s*\(use-state" code)]
    (reduce (fn [acc [full-match var-name]]
              (string/replace acc
                             (str "let [" var-name "] (use-state")
                             (str "let [[" var-name " set-" var-name "] (use-state")))
            code atoms)))
```

### State Management Migration

**RAtom to Hooks Migration**:
```clojure
;; Migration patterns for state management

;; Before: Reagent atom
(def counter (reagent/atom 0))
(defn reagent-counter []
  [:div
   [:p "Count: " @counter]
   [:button {:on-click #(swap! counter inc)} "Increment"]])

;; After: UIx with use-state
(defui uix-counter []
  (let [[count set-count] (use-state 0)]
    ($ :div
       ($ :p (str "Count: " count))
       ($ :button {:on-click #(set-count inc)} "Increment"))))

;; Complex state migration
;; Before: Multiple atoms
(def user-profile (reagent/atom {:name "" :email ""}))
(def loading? (reagent/atom false))

;; After: Single use-state with map
(defui user-form []
  (let [[state set-state] (use-state {:name "" :email "" :loading? false})]
    ;; Component logic
    ))
```

**Global State Migration**:
```clojure
;; Before: Global reagent atoms
(def app-state (reagent/atom {:user nil :theme :light}))
(def current-route (reagent/atom :home))

;; After: React Context + useReducer
(def app-context (create-context))

(defn app-reducer [state action]
  (case (:type action)
    :set-user (assoc state :user (:payload action))
    :set-theme (assoc state :theme (:payload action))
    :set-route (assoc state :current-route (:payload action))
    state))

(defui app-provider [{:keys [children]}]
  (let [[state dispatch] (use-reducer app-reducer {:user nil :theme :light :current-route :home})]
    ($ app-context.Provider {:value {:state state :dispatch dispatch}}
       children)))

;; Usage in components
(defui theme-toggle []
  (let [{:keys [state dispatch]} (use-context app-context)]
    ($ :button {:on-click #(dispatch {:type :set-theme
                                     :payload (if (= (:theme state) :light) :dark :light)})}
       "Toggle Theme")))
```

### Effects and Lifecycle Migration

**Form-3 to useEffect Migration**:
```clojure
;; Before: Form-3 lifecycle
(defn data-fetcher [user-id]
  (let [data (reagent/atom nil)]
    (reagent/create-class
     {:component-did-mount
      (fn [this]
        (fetch-user-data user-id #(reset! data %)))

      :component-did-update
      (fn [this [_ old-user-id]]
        (when (not= old-user-id user-id)
          (fetch-user-data user-id #(reset! data %))))

      :component-will-unmount
      (fn [this]
        ;; Cleanup logic
        )

      :reagent-render
      (fn [user-id]
        [:div (str "Data: " @data)])})))

;; After: UIx with useEffect
(defui data-fetcher [{:keys [user-id]}]
  (let [[data set-data] (use-state nil)
        [loading? set-loading] (use-state true)]

    (use-effect
     (fn []
       (set-loading true)
       (let [controller (js/AbortController.)]
         (-> (fetch-user-data user-id controller.signal)
             (.then (fn [result]
                      (set-data result)))
             (.catch (fn [error]
                       (when-not (.-aborted error)
                         (console.error "Fetch error:" error))))
             (.finally (fn []
                         (set-loading false))))
         ;; Return cleanup function
         (fn []
           (.abort controller))))
     [user-id]) ;; Dependency array

    (cond
      loading? ($ loading-spinner)
      :else ($ :div (str "Data: " data)))))
```

### Routing Migration

**Secretary/Reitit to React Router Migration**:
```clojure
;; Before: Secretary
(defroute "/users/:id" [id]
  (rf/dispatch [:navigate :user {:id id}]))

(defroute "/dashboard" []
  (rf/dispatch [:navigate :dashboard]))

;; After: React Router v6+
(defui app-router []
  ($ react-router/BrowserRouter
     ($ react-router/Routes
        ($ react-router/Route {:path "/users/:id" :element ($ user-page)})
        ($ react-router/Route {:path "/dashboard" :element ($ dashboard-page)}))))

(defui user-page []
  (let [params (react-router/use-params)
        user-id (:id params)]
    ($ user-detail {:user-id user-id})))

(defui navigation []
  (let [navigate (react-router/use-navigate)]
    ($ :nav
       ($ :button {:on-click #(navigate "/dashboard")} "Dashboard")
       ($ :button {:on-click #(navigate "/users/123")} "User 123"))))
```

### Testing Migration

**Component Testing Migration**:
```clojure
;; Before: Reagent testing
(deftest reagent-component-test
  (let [component (reagent/render [counter] (js/document.createElement "div"))]
    ;; Manual DOM manipulation
    (is (= "Count: 0" (.. component -textContent)))
    ;; Manual event simulation
    ))

;; After: UIx with React Testing Library
(deftest uix-component-test
  (let [user (rtl/render ($ counter))
        button (rtl/getByRole user "button")]

    ;; Assert initial state
    (is (rtl/getByText user "Count: 0"))

    ;; Simulate user interaction
    (rtl/fireEvent.click button)

    ;; Assert updated state
    (is (rtl/getByText user "Count: 1"))))
```

### Migration Tools and Automation

**Automated Migration Script**:
```clojure
;; migration-helper.cljs
(ns migration-helper
  (:require [clojure.string :as str]
            [cljs.reader :as reader]))

(defn migrate-file [file-path]
  "Migrate a single Reagent file to UIx"
  (let [content (slurp file-path)
        migrated-content (-> content
                           (migrate-namespaces)
                           (migrate-components)
                           (migrate-state)
                           (migrate-effects)
                           (migrate-routing))]
    (spit file-path migrated-content)
    {:migrated true :file file-path}))

(defn migrate-namespaces [content]
  "Update namespace declarations"
  (-> content
      (str/replace #"reagent\.core" "uix.core")
      (str/replace #"reagent\.dom" "uix.dom")
      (str/replace #"re-frame\.core" "re-frame.core") ;; Keep re-frame if still used
      ))

(defn migrate-components [content]
  "Convert Reagent components to UIx"
  (-> content
      ;; Convert Form-1 to defui
      (str/replace #"^\(defn\s+(\w+)\s*\[([^\]]*)\]"
                   (fn [[_ name args]]
                     (str "(defui " name " [{:keys [" args "]}]")))

      ;; Convert Hiccup to $ macro
      (str/replace #"\[([^\s]+)" "($ $1")

      ;; Close Hiccup vectors
      (str/replace #"\]" ")")))

(defn migrate-state [content]
  "Convert reagent/atom to use-state"
  (-> content
      (str/replace #"reagent/atom" "use-state")
      (str/replace #"swap!" "set-") ;; This is a simplification
      (str/replace #"@(\w+)" "$1") ;; Remove deref
      ))

(defn batch-migrate [project-root]
  "Migrate entire project"
  (let [cljs-files (find-cljs-files project-root)]
    (doseq [file cljs-files]
      (try
        (migrate-file file)
        (println "Migrated:" file)
        (catch js/Error e
          (println "Error migrating" file ":" e))))))
```

### Migration Verification

**Migration Health Check**:
```clojure
(defn verify-migration [project-root]
  "Verify migration completeness and correctness"
  (let [files (find-cljs-files project-root)
        issues []]

    (doseq [file files]
      (let [content (slurp file)]
        (cond
          ;; Check for remaining reagent/atom usage
          (re-find #"reagent/atom" content)
          (conj issues {:file file :type :remaining-ratom :line (find-line content #"reagent/atom")})

          ;; Check for unmigrated Hiccup
          (and (re-find #"\[" content) (not (re-find #"\$\s*\(" content)))
          (conj issues {:file file :type :unmigrated-hiccup :line (find-line content #"\[")})

          ;; Check for missing use-state destructuring
          (and (re-find #"use-state" content) (not (re-find #"\[.*\].*\(use-state" content)))
          (conj issues {:file file :type :missing-destructuring :line (find-line content #"use-state")})

          ;; Add more checks...
          )))

    {:total-files (count files)
     :issues issues
     :health-score (calculate-health-score issues)}))

(defn calculate-health-score [issues]
  "Calculate migration health score (0-100)"
  (let [total-issues (count issues)]
    (max 0 (- 100 (* total-issues 5)))))
```

### Performance Optimization Post-Migration

**Bundle Analysis and Optimization**:
```clojure
;; Post-migration optimization recommendations
(defn analyze-bundle [build-output]
  "Analyze bundle size and provide optimization recommendations"
  (let [analysis (parse-bundle-stats build-output)]
    {:total-size (:total analysis)
     :chunk-sizes (:chunks analysis)
     :recommendations
     (cond-> []
       (> (:total analysis) 500000) (conj "Consider code splitting for large bundles")
       (> (count (:chunks analysis)) 10) (conj "Too many chunks - consolidate where possible")
       (some #(< % 10000) (:chunk-sizes analysis)) (conj "Some chunks are very small - consider merging")
       )}))

(defn optimize-post-migration [project-root]
  "Apply post-migration optimizations"
  [
   ;; 1. Update package.json for better tree shaking
   {:action :update-package-json
    :description "Add sideEffects: false for better tree shaking"}

   ;; 2. Configure dynamic imports for code splitting
   {:action :add-dynamic-imports
    :description "Replace static imports with dynamic imports for large components"}

   ;; 3. Update Shadow-CLJS config for optimization
   {:action :optimize-shadow-config
    :description "Configure advanced optimizations and externs"}

   ;; 4. Add bundle analyzer
   {:action :add-bundle-analyzer
    :description "Add webpack-bundle-analyzer for size analysis"}
   ])
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### State Management Issues
```clojure
;; Issue: State not updating in child components
;; Solution: Use proper dependency arrays in useEffect
(use-effect
 (fn []
   (fetch-data user-id))
 [user-id]) ;; Include all dependencies

;; Issue: Infinite re-renders
;; Solution: Memoize expensive computations
(let [filtered-data (use-memo
                     (fn [] (filter-data data search-term))
                     [data search-term])]
  ;; Use filtered-data
  )
```

### Effect Cleanup Issues
```clojure
;; Issue: Memory leaks from uncleaned effects
;; Solution: Always return cleanup functions
(use-effect
 (fn []
   (let [interval (js/setInterval callback 1000)]
     (fn [] (js/clearInterval interval)))) ;; Cleanup
 [])
```

### Component Re-rendering Issues
```clojure
;; Issue: Unnecessary re-renders
;; Solution: Use useCallback for stable function references
(let [handle-click (use-callback
                    (fn [] (dispatch {:type :click}))
                    [])] ;; Empty deps for stable reference
  ($ :button {:on-click handle-click} "Click"))
```
