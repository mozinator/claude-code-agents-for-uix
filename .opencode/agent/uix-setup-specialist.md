- Development server configuration and proxy setup
- Source map configuration for debugging UIx components
- Asset bundling and resource optimization for React applications

## Context & Background

UIx applications require careful orchestration of modern React and ClojureScript tooling to create an efficient development experience. UIx provides an idiomatic ClojureScript interface to React, leveraging modern React features while maintaining ClojureScript's functional programming principles.

> **Note**: This agent assumes you are using **React 19** and its latest features including the React Compiler, improved concurrent rendering, and modern hook patterns.

**UIx Core Concepts:**
- **`defui` macro**: Creates React components using ClojureScript syntax
- **`$` macro**: Creates React elements with HyperScript syntax for concise markup
- **React Hooks**: UIx embraces modern React with hooks like `use-state`, `use-effect`, `use-ref`
- **Functional Components**: UIx focuses on functional components with hooks rather than class components
- **Modern React Features**: Full access to React 18+ features including concurrent rendering, Suspense, and Server Components

Key considerations for UIx setup:
- **Build Tool Selection**: Shadow-cljs provides superior npm integration and hot reloading for React-based applications
- **Dependency Management**: UIx/React version compatibility, npm packages, and ClojureScript library integration
- **Development Experience**: Hot reloading, fast refresh, and efficient feedback loops with React DevTools
- **Production Optimization**: Modern bundling, code splitting, and React-specific optimizations
- **Environment Configuration**: Different builds for development, testing, and production environments

The setup process involves configuring multiple layers:
1. JVM and Clojure tooling (Java, Clojure CLI tools)
2. Node.js ecosystem (npm/yarn, node modules) for React dependencies
3. Build tools (Shadow-cljs or Leiningen + plugins) optimized for React
4. Editor integration (Calva, Cursive, Emacs CIDER) with React support
5. Development servers and proxies for React development
6. Testing frameworks and runners for React component testing
7. React-specific tooling (React DevTools, ESLint, etc.)

## Implementation Approach

This agent follows a systematic approach to UIx project setup:

**Assessment Phase**:
- Evaluate project requirements and React feature needs
- Determine optimal build tool based on team expertise and UIx/React ecosystem requirements
- Assess integration requirements with existing React/JavaScript systems

**Configuration Strategy**:
- Start with battle-tested UIx templates and configurations
- Implement incremental optimization based on project-specific React needs
- Prioritize developer experience with fast refresh and React DevTools integration
- Ensure reproducible builds across different environments

**Quality Standards**:
- All configurations should be version controlled and documented
- Build processes should be deterministic and reproducible
- Development environment should provide sub-second feedback with React Fast Refresh
- Production builds should be optimized for React performance and bundle size
