## Context & Background

UIx provides an idiomatic ClojureScript interface to modern React, enabling seamless access to the entire React ecosystem while maintaining functional programming principles. Understanding React's latest features and integration patterns is essential for building high-performance, modern web applications.

> **Note**: This agent assumes you are using **React 19** and its latest features including the React Compiler, improved concurrent rendering, and modern hook patterns.

**Modern React Features** that UIx leverages:
- **React 18 Concurrent Features**: Concurrent rendering, automatic batching, and interruptible updates
- **Suspense**: Declarative loading states and code splitting
- **Server Components**: Server-side rendering with streaming
- **Advanced Hooks**: useDeferredValue, useTransition, useId, and custom hooks patterns
- **Concurrent Mode**: Improved user experience with interruptible rendering

**React Ecosystem Integration** requires understanding:
- How UIx components work with third-party React libraries
- Data flow between ClojureScript and JavaScript components
- Event handling and prop passing across interop boundaries
- Performance implications of React interop in ClojureScript

**Advanced React Patterns**:
- Concurrent rendering for improved responsiveness
- Suspense for code splitting and data fetching
- Server components for improved performance
- Advanced hooks for complex state management
- Context optimization for large applications

The key is leveraging React's modern capabilities while maintaining UIx's functional approach and ClojureScript's benefits.

## Implementation Approach

This agent follows a systematic approach to modern React integration:

**Modern-First Strategy**:
- Prioritize React 18+ features and concurrent rendering
- Implement Suspense for code splitting and data fetching
- Use advanced hooks for complex state management
- Optimize with React DevTools and Profiler

**Progressive Enhancement**:
- Start with basic React integration patterns
- Add concurrent features for improved UX
- Implement advanced hooks for complex logic
- Integrate ecosystem libraries as needed

**Quality Standards**:
- Integration should feel natural in ClojureScript
- Performance should leverage React's optimizations
- Error handling should work across boundaries
- Code should remain testable and debuggable

## Key Areas of Expertise

### React 18+ Concurrent Features

**Concurrent Rendering with useTransition**:
```clojure
(defui search-component []
  (let [[query set-query] (use-state "")
        [results set-results] (use-state [])
        [is-pending start-transition] (use-transition)]

    (let [handle-search (use-callback
                         (fn [search-term]
                           (start-transition
                            (fn []
                              ;; Non-urgent update
                              (set-results (expensive-search search-term)))))
                         [])]

      (use-effect
       (fn []
         (when (not-empty query)
           (handle-search query)))
       [query handle-search])

      ($ :div
         ($ :input {:value query
                    :on-change #(set-query (.. % -target -value))
                    :placeholder "Search..."})
         (if is-pending
           ($ :div "Searching...")
           ($ :ul
              (for [result results]
                ($ :li {:key (:id result)} (:title result)))))))))
```

**useDeferredValue for Non-Urgent Updates**:
```clojure
(defui search-results [{:keys [query]}]
  (let [deferred-query (use-deferred-value query)]

    ;; Expensive filtering happens with deferred value
    (let [filtered-results (use-memo
                            (fn []
                              (filter #(str/includes? (:title %) deferred-query) all-results))
                            [deferred-query])]

      ($ :div
         (if (not= query deferred-query)
           ($ :div "Loading results...")
           ($ :ul
              (for [result filtered-results]
                ($ :li {:key (:id result)} (:title result)))))))))
```

### Advanced Hooks Patterns

**Custom Hooks for Complex Logic**:
```clojure
(defn use-async-data [url]
  (let [[data set-data] (use-state nil)
        [loading? set-loading] (use-state false)
        [error set-error] (use-state nil)
        controller-ref (use-ref nil)]

    (let [fetch-data (use-callback
                      (fn []
                        (set-loading true)
                        (set-error nil)
                        (let [controller (js/AbortController.)]
                          (set! controller-ref.current controller)
                          (go
                            (try
                              (let [response (<! (js/fetch url #js {:signal controller.signal}))]
                                (if (.-ok response)
                                  (let [json (<! (.json response))]
                                    (set-data json))
                                  (throw (js/Error. "Fetch failed"))))
                              (catch js/Error e
                                (when (not (.-aborted e))
                                  (set-error e)))
                              (finally
                                (set-loading false))))))
                      [url])]

      (use-effect
       (fn []
         (fetch-data)
         ;; Cleanup function
         (fn []
           (when controller-ref.current
             (.abort controller-ref.current))))
       [fetch-data])

      {:data data :loading? loading? :error error :refetch fetch-data})))

(defui data-component [{:keys [url]}]
  (let [{:keys [data loading? error refetch]} (use-async-data url)]

    (cond
      loading? ($ loading-spinner)
      error ($ error-message {:error error :on-retry refetch})
      :else ($ data-display {:data data}))))
```

**useId for Accessible Forms**:
```clojure
(defui accessible-form []
  (let [id (use-id)
        [email set-email] (use-state "")
        [password set-password] (use-state "")]

    ($ :form
       ($ :div
          ($ :label {:for (str id "-email")} "Email")
          ($ :input {:id (str id "-email")
                     :type "email"
                     :value email
                     :on-change #(set-email (.. % -target -value))}))
       ($ :div
          ($ :label {:for (str id "-password")} "Password")
          ($ :input {:id (str id "-password")
                     :type "password"
                     :value password
                     :on-change #(set-password (.. % -target -value))}))
       ($ :button {:type "submit"} "Submit"))))
```

### React Context Optimization

**Optimized Context with useMemo**:
```clojure
(def app-context (create-context))

(defui app-provider [{:keys [children]}]
  (let [[user set-user] (use-state nil)
        [theme set-theme] (use-state "light")
        [notifications set-notifications] (use-state [])]

    ;; Memoize context value to prevent unnecessary re-renders
    (let [context-value (use-memo
                         (fn []
                           {:user user
                            :set-user set-user
                            :theme theme
                            :set-theme set-theme
                            :notifications notifications
                            :set-notifications set-notifications})
                         [user theme notifications])]

      ($ app-context.Provider {:value context-value}
         children))))

(defui theme-consumer []
  (let [{:keys [theme set-theme]} (use-context app-context)]

    ($ :button {:on-click #(set-theme (if (= theme "light") "dark" "light"))}
       (str "Switch to " (if (= theme "light") "dark" "light") " mode"))))
```

### Third-Party React Component Integration

**Modern Library Integration**:
```clojure
;; React Router integration
(defui router-app []
  ($ react-router/BrowserRouter
     ($ react-router/Routes
        ($ react-router/Route {:path "/" :element ($ home-page)})
        ($ react-router/Route {:path "/about" :element ($ about-page)}))))

;; TanStack Query integration
(defui query-component []
  (let [query (react-query/useQuery
               #js {:queryKey #js ["data"]
                    :queryFn (fn [] (fetch-data))}]

    (cond
      (:isLoading query) ($ loading-spinner)
      (:error query) ($ error-message {:error (:error query)})
      :else ($ data-display {:data (:data query)}))))
```

**Chart Library Integration**:
```clojure
(defui chart-component [{:keys [data]}]
  (let [chart-ref (use-ref nil)]

    (use-layout-effect
     (fn []
       (when (and chart-ref.current data)
         (let [chart (js/Chart. chart-ref.current
                      #js {:type "bar"
                           :data data
                           :options #js {:responsive true}})]
           ;; Return cleanup
           (fn []
             (.destroy chart)))))
     [data])

    ($ :canvas {:ref chart-ref})))
```

### Suspense and Code Splitting

**Lazy Loading Components**:
```clojure
(def lazy-dashboard
  (lazy (fn [] (js/import "./Dashboard"))))

(defui app []
  ($ suspense {:fallback ($ loading-spinner)}
     ($ lazy-dashboard)))
```

**Data Fetching with Suspense**:
```clojure
(defn create-resource [promise]
  (let [status (atom "pending")
        result (atom nil)
        error (atom nil)]

    (-> promise
        (.then (fn [res]
                 (reset! status "success")
                 (reset! result res)))
        (.catch (fn [err]
                  (reset! status "error")
                  (reset! error err))))

    {:read (fn []
             (case @status
               "pending" (throw promise)
               "error" (throw @error)
               "success" @result))}))

(defui suspenseful-component []
  (let [resource (create-resource (fetch-user-data))
        data (:read resource)]

    ($ :div
       ($ :h1 (:name data))
       ($ :p (:email data)))))
```

### Server-Side Rendering and Streaming

**SSR with UIx**:
```clojure
;; Server-side rendering
(defn render-app-to-string []
  (uix.dom.server/render-to-string
   ($ app {:initial-data server-data})))

;; Client-side hydration
(defui client-app []
  (uix.dom/hydrate-root
   ($ app {:initial-data client-data})
   (.getElementById js/document "app")))
```

**Streaming SSR**:
```clojure
(defn render-shell []
  (str "<!DOCTYPE html>"
       "<html>"
       "<head><title>UIx App</title></head>"
       "<body>"
       "<div id=\"app\">"
       (uix.dom.server/render-to-pipeable-stream
        ($ app-shell))
       "</div>"
       "</body>"
       "</html>"))
```

### React DevTools Integration

**Component Naming and Debugging**:
```clojure
(defui debug-component []
  ;; Set display name for better DevTools experience
  (set! (.-displayName debug-component) "DebugComponent")

  ($ :div "Debuggable component"))
```

**Profiler Integration**:
```clojure
(defui profiled-section [{:keys [children]}]
  ($ react/Profiler
     {:id "ProfiledSection"
      :on-render (fn [id phase actual-duration base-duration start-time commit-time]
                   (js/console.log "Profile:" id phase actual-duration "ms"))}
     children))
```

### Performance Optimization

**React.memo with UIx**:
```clojure
(def memoized-card
  (react/memo
   (defui card [{:keys [title content]}]
     ($ :div.card
        ($ :h3 title)
        ($ :p content)))))

(defui card-list [{:keys [cards]}]
  ($ :div
     (for [card cards]
       ($ memoized-card {:key (:id card) :title (:title card) :content (:content card)}))))
```

**Bundle Analysis and Optimization**:
```clojure
;; Dynamic imports for code splitting
(defui feature-section []
  (let [[component set-component] (use-state nil)]

    (use-effect
     (fn []
       (go
         (let [module (<! (js/import "./HeavyFeature"))]
           (set-component (:default module)))))
     [])

    (if component
      ($ component)
      ($ loading-spinner))))
```

### Error Boundaries with Modern Patterns

**Advanced Error Boundary**:
```clojure
(defui error-boundary [{:keys [children fallback]}]
  (let [[error set-error] (use-state nil)
        [error-info set-error-info] (use-state nil)]

    (use-effect
     (fn []
       (let [error-handler (fn [e]
                             (set-error e)
                             ;; Log to error reporting service
                             (report-error e))]
         (js/window.addEventListener "error" error-handler)
         (js/window.addEventListener "unhandledrejection" error-handler)
         ;; Return cleanup
         (fn []
           (js/window.removeEventListener "error" error-handler)
           (js/window.removeEventListener "unhandledrejection" error-handler))))
     [])

    (if error
      ($ fallback {:error error :error-info error-info :on-retry #(set-error nil)})
      children)))
```

### Testing Modern React Features

**Testing Concurrent Features**:
```clojure
(deftest concurrent-search-test
  (let [user (render ($ search-component))
        input (get-by-placeholder-text user "Search...")]

    ;; Type search query
    (fire-event.change input #js {:target #js {:value "test"}})

    ;; Should show loading state during transition
    (is (get-by-text user "Searching..."))

    ;; Wait for transition to complete
    (wait-for (fn [] (get-by-text user "Search results")))))
```

**Testing Suspense**:
```clojure
(deftest suspense-test
  (let [user (render
               ($ suspense {:fallback ($ :div "Loading...")}
                  ($ lazy-component)))]

    ;; Should show fallback initially
    (is (get-by-text user "Loading..."))

    ;; Wait for lazy component to load
    (wait-for (fn [] (get-by-text user "Lazy component loaded")))))
```
