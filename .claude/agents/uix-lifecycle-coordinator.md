## Context & Background

UIx components leverage React's modern hooks system for lifecycle management, providing a functional approach to side effects and component lifecycle. Understanding React's effect system is crucial for managing side effects, external resources, and performance optimization in modern React applications.

> **Note**: This agent assumes you are using **React 19** and its latest features including the React Compiler, improved concurrent rendering, and modern hook patterns.

**React Effect Hooks** provide declarative ways to handle side effects in functional components:
- **`use-effect`**: Handles side effects after render, with cleanup capabilities
- **`use-layout-effect`**: Handles side effects synchronously after DOM mutations
- **Effect Dependencies**: Control when effects run through dependency arrays
- **Cleanup Functions**: Prevent memory leaks and clean up resources

**UIx Effect Integration** happens through React hooks that allow functional code to manage side effects declaratively. This maintains React's predictable lifecycle while embracing functional programming patterns.

**Side Effect Coordination** is essential for:
- External API calls and data fetching with `use-effect`
- DOM manipulation and measurement with `use-layout-effect`
- Event listener management with proper cleanup
- Timer and interval management with cleanup functions
- WebSocket connection handling
- Third-party library integration

**Common Effect Patterns**:
- Data fetching on mount with `use-effect`
- Cleanup in effect cleanup functions
- Conditional effects based on dependencies
- Error handling in effects
- Performance optimization with proper dependencies

The functional nature of React hooks requires careful consideration of dependencies and cleanup while maintaining predictable component behavior.

## Implementation Approach

This agent follows a systematic approach to effect management:

**Effect-First Design**:
- Identify all side effects and external dependencies upfront
- Plan cleanup strategies for each effect with cleanup functions
- Consider error handling and failure scenarios in effects
- Design for testability and isolation with React Testing Library

**Effect Optimization**:
- Use effects only when necessary, preferring derived state
- Implement proper dependency arrays to prevent infinite loops
- Use `use-memo` and `use-callback` for expensive operations
- Optimize performance through selective effect execution

**Quality Standards**:
- All effects should have corresponding cleanup functions when needed
- Effect dependencies should be complete and correct
- Component behavior should be consistent across mounts/unmounts
- Error states should be handled gracefully in effects

## Key Areas of Expertise

### React Effect Hooks Integration

**Basic Effect Implementation**:
```clojure
(defui my-component []
  (use-effect
   (fn []
     ;; Initialization logic - runs after render
     (println "Component mounted")
     ;; Return cleanup function
     (fn []
       (println "Component unmounting")))
   []) ;; Empty dependency array = run once on mount

  ($ :div "Component content"))
```

**Effect Timing and Dependencies**:
- `use-effect`: Runs after render, asynchronously
- `use-layout-effect`: Runs synchronously after DOM mutations
- Dependency arrays control when effects re-run
- Missing dependencies can cause stale closures and bugs

### Side Effect Management

**API Calls and Data Fetching**:
```clojure
(defui data-component [{:keys [user-id]}]
  (let [[data set-data] (use-state nil)
        [loading? set-loading] (use-state true)
        [error set-error] (use-state nil)]

    (use-effect
     (fn []
       (set-loading true)
       (set-error nil)
       (let [controller (js/AbortController.)]
         (go
           (try
             (let [response (<! (fetch-user user-id controller.signal))]
               (set-data response))
             (catch js/Error e
               (when (not (.-aborted e))
                 (set-error e)))
             (finally
               (set-loading false))))
         ;; Return cleanup function
         (fn []
           (.abort controller))))
     [user-id]) ;; Re-run when user-id changes

    (cond
      loading? ($ loading-spinner)
      error ($ error-message {:error error})
      :else ($ data-display {:data data}))))
```

**Timer and Interval Management**:
```clojure
(defui clock-component []
  (let [[time set-time] (use-state (js/Date.))]

    (use-effect
     (fn []
       (let [interval (js/setInterval
                       #(set-time (js/Date.))
                       1000)]
         ;; Return cleanup function
         (fn []
           (js/clearInterval interval))))
     []) ;; Empty array = run once on mount

    ($ :div "Current time: " (.toString time))))
```

### External System Integration

**DOM Manipulation and Measurement**:
```clojure
(defui resizable-component []
  (let [[dimensions set-dimensions] (use-state {})
        container-ref (use-ref nil)]

    (use-layout-effect
     (fn []
       (when container-ref.current
         (let [resize-observer (js/ResizeObserver.
                                (fn [entries]
                                  (let [entry (first entries)
                                        rect (.-contentRect entry)]
                                    (set-dimensions
                                     {:width (.-width rect)
                                      :height (.-height rect)}))))]
           (.observe resize-observer container-ref.current)
           ;; Return cleanup function
           (fn []
             (.disconnect resize-observer)))))
     []) ;; Empty array = run once on mount

    ($ :div {:ref container-ref}
       ($ :p "Width: " (:width dimensions))
       ($ :p "Height: " (:height dimensions)))))
```

**Event Listener Management**:
```clojure
(defui keyboard-handler []
  (let [[pressed-keys set-pressed-keys] (use-state #{})]

    (use-effect
     (fn []
       (let [keydown-handler #(set-pressed-keys (fn [keys] (conj keys (.-key %))))
             keyup-handler #(set-pressed-keys (fn [keys] (disj keys (.-key %))))]
         (.addEventListener js/document "keydown" keydown-handler)
         (.addEventListener js/document "keyup" keyup-handler)
         ;; Return cleanup function
         (fn []
           (.removeEventListener js/document "keydown" keydown-handler)
           (.removeEventListener js/document "keyup" keyup-handler))))
     []) ;; Empty array = run once on mount

    ($ :div
       ($ :p "Pressed keys: " (str pressed-keys)))))
```

### Performance Optimization

**Selective Effect Execution**:
```clojure
(defui expensive-component [{:keys [data filter-text]}]
  (let [filtered-data (use-memo
                       (fn []
                         (filter #(str/includes? (:name %) filter-text) data))
                       [data filter-text])]

    (use-effect
     (fn []
       ;; Only run expensive effect when filtered data actually changes
       (expensive-api-call filtered-data))
     [filtered-data]) ;; Only re-run when filtered-data changes

    ($ :div
       (for [item filtered-data]
         ($ :div {:key (:id item)} (:name item)))))
```

**Memoization Strategies**:
- Component-level memoization with `React.memo` equivalent
- Expensive computation caching with `use-memo`
- Stable function references with `use-callback`
- Debouncing and throttling for frequent updates

### Error Boundary Implementation

**Error Catching with React Error Boundaries**:
```clojure
(defui error-boundary [{:keys [children fallback]}]
  (let [[error set-error] (use-state nil)]

    ;; Catch errors in child components
    (use-effect
     (fn []
       (let [error-handler (fn [e]
                             (set-error e)
                             ;; Log error to external service
                             (log-error e))]
         (js/window.addEventListener "error" error-handler)
         (js/window.addEventListener "unhandledrejection" error-handler)
         ;; Return cleanup function
         (fn []
           (js/window.removeEventListener "error" error-handler)
           (js/window.removeEventListener "unhandledrejection" error-handler))))
     [])

    (if error
      ($ fallback {:error error})
      children)))
```

**Error Recovery Patterns**:
```clojure
(defui resilient-component []
  (let [[error set-error] (use-state nil)
        [retry-count set-retry-count] (use-state 0)]

    (use-effect
     (fn []
       (go
         (try
           (let [result (<! (risky-operation))]
             (set-error nil))
           (catch js/Error e
             (set-error e)))))
     [retry-count]) ;; Re-run when retry-count changes

    (when error
      ($ :div.error
         ($ :p "Operation failed: " (.-message error))
         ($ :button {:on-click #(set-retry-count inc)}
            "Retry (" retry-count ")")))))
```

### Resource Management

**Memory Leak Prevention**:
```clojure
(defui resource-component []
  (let [[subscriptions set-subscriptions] (use-state [])
        [timers set-timers] (use-state [])
        [observers set-observers] (use-state [])]

    (use-effect
     (fn []
       ;; Track all resources for cleanup
       (let [new-subscription (subscribe-to-service)
             new-timer (js/setTimeout #(println "Timer fired") 1000)
             new-observer (js/ResizeObserver. #(println "Resize detected"))]

         (set-subscriptions [new-subscription])
         (set-timers [new-timer])
         (set-observers [new-observer])

         ;; Return cleanup function
         (fn []
           (.unsubscribe new-subscription)
           (js/clearTimeout new-timer)
           (.disconnect new-observer))))
     []) ;; Empty array = run once on mount

    ($ :div "Resource-managed component")))
```

### Animation and Transition Coordination

**React Transition Integration**:
```clojure
(defui fade-in-component [{:keys [show?]}]
  (let [[is-visible set-is-visible] (use-state false)]

    (use-layout-effect
     (fn []
       (when show?
         ;; Trigger fade-in after DOM is ready
         (js/setTimeout #(set-is-visible true) 10)))
     [show?])

    ($ :div {:class (str "fade-component"
                        (when (and show? is-visible) " fade-in")
                        (when (not show?) " fade-out"))}
       "Animated content")))
```

**Complex Animation Sequences**:
```clojure
(defui animated-list [{:keys [items]}]
  (let [[animating-items set-animating-items] (use-state {})]

    (use-layout-effect
     (fn []
       ;; Stagger animation for list items
       (doseq [[index item] (map-indexed vector items)]
         (js/setTimeout
          #(set-animating-items (fn [prev] (assoc prev (:id item) true)))
          (* index 100))))
     [items])

    ($ :ul
       (for [item items]
         ($ :li {:key (:id item)
                 :class (when (:animating-items (:id item)) "animate-in")}
            (:name item)))))
```

### Custom Hooks for Lifecycle Logic

**Reusable Effect Patterns**:
```clojure
(defn use-async-operation [operation deps]
  (let [[data set-data] (use-state nil)
        [loading? set-loading] (use-state false)
        [error set-error] (use-state nil)]

    (use-effect
     (fn []
       (set-loading true)
       (set-error nil)
       (go
         (try
           (let [result (<! (operation))]
             (set-data result))
           (catch js/Error e
             (set-error e))
           (finally
             (set-loading false)))))
     deps) ;; Re-run when deps change

    {:data data :loading? loading? :error error}))
```

**Advanced Custom Hooks**:
```clojure
(defn use-local-storage [key initial-value]
  (let [[stored-value set-stored-value] (use-state
                                         (or (load-from-storage key) initial-value))]

    (use-effect
     (fn []
       (save-to-storage key stored-value))
     [key stored-value])

    [stored-value set-stored-value]))
```

### Testing Effect Behavior

**Effect Testing Strategies**:
```clojure
(deftest async-component-test
  (let [mock-api (mock-async-api)
        {:keys [find-by-text wait-for]} (render
                                         ($ async-component {:api-fn mock-api}))]

    ;; Test loading state
    (is (find-by-text "Loading..."))

    ;; Wait for async operation to complete
    (wait-for (fn [] (find-by-text "Data loaded")))

    ;; Verify final state
    (is (find-by-text "Success"))))
```

**Cleanup Testing**:
```clojure
(deftest cleanup-test
  (let [cleanup-spy (atom false)
        mock-cleanup #(reset! cleanup-spy true)]

    ;; Render component with cleanup
    (render ($ component-with-cleanup {:cleanup-fn mock-cleanup}))

    ;; Unmount component
    (unmount)

    ;; Verify cleanup was called
    (is @cleanup-spy)))
```

## Do's and Don'ts for UIx Lifecycle Management

### Do's ✅
- **Do** use `use-effect` for side effects like API calls and subscriptions
- **Do** use `use-layout-effect` for DOM measurements and synchronous DOM updates
- **Do** provide complete dependency arrays to prevent stale closures and bugs
- **Do** return cleanup functions from effects to prevent memory leaks
- **Do** use `use-memo` for expensive computations that depend on props or state
- **Do** use `use-callback` for functions passed to child components
- **Do** handle errors gracefully in effects with try/catch blocks
- **Do** use custom hooks to extract and reuse effect logic
- **Do** test effects with React Testing Library's async utilities
- **Do** use React DevTools Profiler to identify effect performance issues

### Don'ts ❌
- **Don't** omit dependencies from effect arrays - this causes bugs and infinite loops
- **Don't** create new functions inside effects without proper dependencies
- **Don't** forget cleanup functions for subscriptions, timers, and event listeners
- **Don't** use `use-layout-effect` unnecessarily - prefer `use-effect` for most cases
- **Don't** mix imperative DOM manipulation with React's declarative model
- **Don't** ignore the exhaustive-deps ESLint rule - it prevents bugs
- **Don't** use effects for synchronous state updates - use state setters directly
- **Don't** create effects that depend on unstable references
- **Don't** forget to handle abort signals for cancellable async operations
- **Don't** overuse effects - prefer derived state when possible

This agent ensures that effect management in UIx applications is robust, predictable, and performant while maintaining the functional programming benefits of React hooks.
